### 1. Introduction

This is one of my academic project for a course named "Numerical Computation" in my BS CS program year 99-2002. I made
this project to practice and implement some of the numerical computation techniques and to make a GUI based application
so that my dear instructor/teacher of the course can use it.

### 2. Numerical Techniques Implementations

The following numerical techniques has being implemented in the application ...

- Solving the ** root **
- Solving a ** linear system of equations ** with techniques
    - Elimination
    - Jacobi
    - Gauss Seidel
- ** Interpolation ** with techniques ...
    - Lagrangian
    - Neville
    - Newton
    - Natural Cubic Spline

Besides that the application also provide tools such as ...

- A ** scientific calculator **
- A ** function plotter/grapher **

### 3. Tech Stack

This is a plan **Java GUI application**, utilizing the **AWT**, and **Swing frameworks* ***.
The original application was written on Java 1.2, and it now ported to run on latest JVMs, tested on Java 14.
